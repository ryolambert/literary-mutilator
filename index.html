					course. I've been programmed by you predators. B'Elanna Torres: [last lines in "Barge of the Dead"]
					Mother? Oh god, I'm alive! [throws her arms around Janeway] Captain Janeway: [hugs B'Elanna] Welcome
					back. [after Seska is unmasked as a Cardassian spy] Seska: I did it for you. I did it for this crew. We
					are alone here, at the mercy of any number of hostile aliens, because of the incomprehensible decision of
					a Federation captain. A Federation captain who destroyed our only chance to get home. Federation rules.
					Federation nobility. Federation compassion? Do you understand, if this had been a Cardassian ship, we
					would be home now. We must begin to forge alliances. To survive, we must have powerful friends. The
					Kazon-Nistrim were willing to be our protectors in return for some minor technology. The Doctor: [to
					Seven about Icheb] I must prove to him that persistence is futile. B'Elanna Torres: You know what they
					say: a doctor who treats himself has a p'TaH for a patient.</p>
